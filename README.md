# Better Presence

Track presence using arpscan, ping, iBeacon or other supported provider.  
No Homey phone app needed. Usefull for guests & others ;)

Due Homey security restrictions, this app requires [presence app (click here)][presence-app] running on other device (such as Raspberry Pi), to collect presence data.  
Please see [presence app][presence-app] for supported providers.
